# ============================================================================
# KEY DIFFERENCES: PhD vs Industry Job Search
# ============================================================================

phd_search_notes: |
  === TIMING ===
  - PhDs typically advertised: September-February for September/October start
  - Some rolling admissions year-round
  - Industry: Year-round with peaks in Jan/Feb and Sep/Oct
  
  === SOURCES ===
  - PhDs: University sites, FindAPhD, research council sites
  - Industry: LinkedIn, Indeed, company career pages
  
  === APPLICATION PROCESS ===
  - PhDs: Research proposal, academic references, potentially need supervisor first
  - Industry: CV + cover letter, direct application
  
  === FUNDING ===
  - PhDs: Check if funded (stipend + fees) - only apply to funded positions
  - Industry: Salary negotiations
  
  === FILTERING CRITERIA ===
  - PhDs: Research area match, supervisor expertise, funding status
  - Industry: Role match, salary, location, company culture

# ============================================================================
# DUAL SEARCH STRATEGY
# ============================================================================

dual_search_approach: |
  Run TWO separate agents with different configurations:
  
  AGENT 1: Industry ML Jobs
  - Sources: machinelearningjobs.co.uk, LinkedIn, company sites
  - Criteria: Job title, salary, experience level
  - Notification: Daily at 8 AM
  - Priority: Immediate opportunities
  
  AGENT 2: PhD Positions
  - Sources: FindAPhD, university sites, CDTs, Alan Turing
  - Criteria: Research area, funding status, supervisor match
  - Notification: Daily at 9 AM (or 3x per week)
  - Priority: Strategic long-term positions
  
  WHY SEPARATE?
  1. Different application timelines
  2. Different filtering criteria
  3. Different decision-making processes
  4. Can prioritize one over the other
  5. Easier to track and manage
