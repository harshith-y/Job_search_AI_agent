Since its start as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009, Waymo has focused on building the Waymo Driver\u2014The World's Most Experienced Driver\u2122\u2014to improve access to mobility while saving thousands of lives now lost to traffic crashes. The Waymo Driver powers Waymo\u2019s fully autonomous ride-hail service and can also be applied to a range of vehicle platforms and product use cases. The Waymo Driver has provided over ten million rider-only trips, enabled by its experience autonomously driving over 100 million miles on public roads and tens of billions in simulation across 15+ U.S. states. The Simulator team builds state-of-the-art simulations of realistic environments for the testing and training of the Waymo driver. We use machine learning to model the real world, including realistic agents (vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists etc.), roads, traffic control systems, and weather. To increase the fidelity and steerability of the simulations, we employ large foundation models, trained on our massive datasets that allow us to quickly setup and rollout multiple scenarios to subject our driver to. We are planning to set up a team in London UK to work with the teams in MTV and Oxford to build these foundation models out and to integrate them into several evaluation and training products. We are looking for research engineers to work on these exciting problems. In this hybrid role, you will report to an Engineering Director. You will: Be part of a world class research engineering team to grow the state-of-the-art of ultra realistic AV simulations using foundation models Collaborate with teams in Waymo Oxford to use large models to improve sim realism Design experiments that push the frontiers of AV simulations Develop metrics that measure the realism of simulated worlds Train and evaluate large models and integrate them into the simulator and its downstream ap",

    "description": "The PhD is the primary research degree that can be taken in the Department of Computer Science and Technology. The PhD is a three to four-year full-time (five to seven-year part-time) programme of individual research on a topic agreed upon by the student and the department, under the guidance of a staff member as the student's Supervisor. All research students are admitted to read for the PhD degree on a probationary basis and will be registered for the Certificate of Postgraduate Study (CPGS) in the first instance. During this year, students may do some additional coursework and will write a research report that is likely to form the foundation of the eventual PhD thesis. The CPGS will involve four components: research skills training practical work research report of no more than 10,000 words attendance at research workshops and research seminars At the end of the third term and on completion of the CPGS, students whose performance indicates that they would be able to complete a PhD in a reasonable time will be upgraded to PhD status. A student who is not upgraded to PhD status and who has completed three terms of study will normally be awarded the CPGS alone. They will not submit a thesis for the PhD degree. All research students are strongly encouraged to contribute to teaching in the department, for which some training will be provided. Research students will submit a log of teaching activities annually at the end of June. Students are expected to complete the substance of their research by the end of their third year, submitting their thesis then or within a few months. Applicants wishing to apply to undertake a PhD on a part-time basis should refer to the department's admissions advice for potential part-time students. Open Days The University hosts and attends fairs and events throughout the year, in the UK and across the world.

    "description": "AI for h ealthcare By Ian Mundell for Imperial Enterprise - supporting industry and entrepreneurship Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a real opportunity in healthcare, not only to automate some of the problem-solving carried out by doctors and other medical professionals, but also to make quicker and better decisions and apply problem-solving techniques that humans alone could not. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis will improve the cost of care, and improve outcomes, simply because things will happen earlier, faster, and better,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Dr Aldo Faisal , who leads Imperial\u00e2\u0080\u0099s UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in AI for Healthcare . \u00e2\u0080\u009cRather than replacing people with machines, creating unemployment, we foresee this as a way of dealing with the growing unmet need for clinical care.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The challenges involved touch on some of the hottest topics in AI research. For example, when you are dealing with people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health, the explainability of AI \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our ability to understand why systems have made certain decisions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 becomes much more important. This means dealing with human\u00e2\u0080\u0093machine interaction, trust and the security of AI systems, and questions about autonomy. It also means operating in settings where there is tight regulation. AI will make things happen earlier, faster, and better. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAI for healthcare embodies everything that makes AI in general interesting\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Dr Faisal. He divides AI for healthcare into two broad categories. Perceptual AI replicates the ability of healthcare professionals to perceive disease, a skill that goes to the heart of diagnosis and monitoring. And intervention AI addresses decisions about how patients should be treated. Imperial College London is active in both domains.
